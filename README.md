### Attributes

[**core model attributes**](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Core-model-attributes): These are inherited by every Adapt component. [Read more](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Core-model-attributes).

**\_component** (string): This value must be: `text`.

**\_classes** (string): CSS class name to be applied to **List**â€™s containing `div`. The class must be predefined in one of the Less files. Separate multiple classes with a space. Supported classes are `"align-items-vert-center"` which aligns either the step number or image centrally, on the vertical axis, with the content.

**\_layout** (string): This defines the horizontal position of the component in the block. Acceptable values are `full`, `left` or `right`.

**\_animateList** (boolean): If set to `true`, the list of items will animate when scrolled into view. The default value is `false`.

**\_percentInviewVertical** (number): Controls what percentage of the list items height needs to be in the viewport in order for the items to animate. Default value is to animate when 70% 'in view'. You only need to set this property if you want to override the default value.

**\_orderedList** (boolean): If set to `true`, each item in the list will numbered. The default value is `false`.

**\_columns** (number): Defines the number of columns wide the **\_items** are displayed in. If the value of **\_numberOfColumns** is `2`, each **\_items** will be 50% wide. Similarly, if the value of **\_numberOfColumns** is `3`, each **\_items** will be 33.3% wide. In tablet view, the width of each **\_items** is 50%. In mobile view, the width of each **\_items** is 100%.

**\_items** (string): Multiple items may be created. Each item represents one list item for this component and contains values for **title**, **body**, **\_imageSrc** and **alt**.

>**title** (string): This is the title text for the list item.

>**body** (string): This is the main body text for the list item.

>**\_imageSrc** (string):  File name (including path) of the image. Path should be relative to the *src* folder (e.g., *course/en/images/origami-menu-two.jpg*). Only supported when **\_orderedList** is set to `false`.
